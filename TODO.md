# TODO

* Add standard prefix includes and and rpath flag to CMake builds (present in autotools).
* Add wemux. Will probably have to patch it to get it to work as a standard user.
* Decide standard of hyphens (probably) or underscores (probably not) and stick to them for functions, aliases, commands, and file names.
